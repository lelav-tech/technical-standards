# Branching Strategy

## Rules

Pushing your contributions to the Lelavâ€™s repositories `MUST` follow the strategy and guidelines below:

- When working on tasks, always create a new branch from the development branch.
- The branch name should clearly represent the task. For more information, click [here]().
- Each subtask within your main task should have its own commit. This means that even if you have a single main task, it might consist of multiple subtasks, each requiring its own commit.
- Commit messages should be well-described and relevant to the task.
- Once you complete your main task, create a pull request and add `dilovanmatini` as a reviewer so we can review your code. After the review, We will merge your branch into the development branch.
- `NEVER` merge any code directly into the development and production branches.

## Main Branches

The repository has the following main branches:

- `development` - The main branch for development. All other branches should be cloned from this branch.
- `production` - The main branch for production. This branch should only be updated via pull requests and only from the `development` branch. (This operation should be done by Lelav's DevOps).

## Branch Naming

To create a new branch from `development`, you need to follow the naming convention below:

- `feature/*` - Feature branches for new features.
- `bug/*` - Bug branches for bug fixes.
- `hotfix/*` - Hotfix branches for hotfixes for production.
- `chore/*` - Chore branches for chores (e.g. refactoring, adding tests, etc.)
- `release/*` - Release branches for new versions of the application.
- `docs/*` - Documentation branches for documentation updates.
- `style/*` - Style branches for style updates (e.g. formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- `refactor/*` - Refactor branches for refactoring of the codebase.
- `test/*` - Test branches for adding missing tests.
- `config/*` - Config branches for configuration updates (e.g. updating .gitignore, package.json, etc.)
- `ci/*` - CI branches for CI updates (e.g. updating Travis CI config, GitHub Actions, etc.)
- `perf/*` - Perf branches for performance updates.
- `vendor/*` - Vendor branches for vendor updates (e.g. updating Laravel, Bootstrap, etc.)
- `security/*` - Security branches for security updates.
- `revert/*` - Revert branches for reverting previous commits.
- `merge/*` - Merge branches for merging previous branches.
- `other/*` - Other branches for any other type of update.

## Cloning the Repository

When cloning the repository, you should always clone the `development` branch. This is the branch that all feature branches should be branched off of.

## Branch Naming

Branches are named based on the following convention:

```
{type}/{issue-number}-{description}
```
